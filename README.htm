<h1 id="structure">structure</h1>
<p>The structure is two weekends/events/sessisons: a &quot;design weekend&quot; (not necessarily literally a weekend) and an &quot;implemntation weekend&quot; (not necessarily literally a weekend).</p>
<h1 id="logistics-for-design-weekend">logistics for design weekend</h1>
<h2 id="forum">forum</h2>
<p>Design weekend opens with a forum, since getting people together encourages generation of critical and crucial questions. We propose that an expert present a deck of slides, supported by any other media useful, to outline the macro problem and a list of potential challenges (see Appendix).</p>
<h2 id="food-and-team-formation">food and team formation</h2>
<p>Forum is followed by a chance for people to echange ideas over food.</p>
<h2 id="workshops">workshops</h2>
<p>(Possibly on subsequent day) Workshops are given on more specific topics, e.g., use of mobile devices+data, to gather experts and idea-generators and implementers around more focused topics</p>
<h2 id="iteration-with-experts">iteration with experts</h2>
<p>Crucial is saving time by shooting down unworkable ideas to iterate, refine, and improve towards constraint satisfaction and meeting design critera. To that end a body of experts must be made available to evaluate short pitches (ideally 2-5 minutes; shorter if idea is clearly in need of existential improvement) from many groups.</p>
<p>E.g., these could be at the top of every hour, to alternate between short pitches and deeper discusion.</p>
<p>This also facilitates rapid review</p>
<h2 id="rapid-review">rapid review</h2>
<p>The review process, a way fof quantifying plausibility, could be as simple as how many experts endorse this idea?</p>
<h2 id="final-review">final review</h2>
<p>At the end of design weekend, ideas with most expert approval are presented to community and judged (including &quot;community favorite&quot;) for suitability of success. Hard and soft resources (i.e., time and money) may be allocated by the Dean for most successful ideas.</p>
<h1 id="logistics-for-implementation-weekend">logistics for implementation weekend</h1>
<p>The logistics for implementation weekend are to be determined by ideas created in the design weekend.</p>

<li><p>As soon as possible, drafts of the forum presentation should be distributed electronically, e.g., by github, google drive, or slideshare. They should not be emailed, and we should not wait until the draft is finalized.</p></li>
<li><p>Idea generators should be encouraged to start now, gather electronically, and have ideas vetted electronically, either via googleform or survey platforms such as http://www.allourideas.org/</p></li>
