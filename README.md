% proposal for a ebola hackathon: "Plan A"

# context

## goals

The 2014
Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa
has the potential to kill 1.2 M (ian lipkin, pers. comm.).
We believe that the impact of the outbreak could
be greatly lessened by a set of technological and
information-based solutions. These need to be
cost effective, deliverable in the time scale of 1-2 months,
and relevant to the realistic constraints set
by polics, public health, and virology.

## attendees

Undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs,
research scientists, and faculty. "Designers" from
many disciplines will be needed, given the
diversity of biological, technological, information,
transportation, and other challenges which come
together to make this outbreak so challenging.
Skills needed are including but not limited to:

- biology
- civil engineering
- virology
- physics
- mechanical engineering
- CS
- urban policy
- health and public policy


# structure

The structure is two weekends/events/sessisons:
a "design weekend" (not necessarily literally a weekend)
and an "implemntation weekend" (not necessarily literally a weekend).

# logistics for design weekend

## forum (likely evening of Thurs 2 October)

Design weekend opens with a forum, since getting people
together encourages generation of critical and crucial questions.
We propose that an expert present a deck of slides,
supported by any other media useful, to outline the
macro problem and a list of potential challenges (see Appendix).

## food and team formation (likely Thu-Friday, Oct 2-3)

Forum is followed by a chance for people to echange ideas over food.

## workshops (likely Thursday or possibly Friday, Oct 3)

(Possibly on subsequent day) Workshops are given
on more specific topics, e.g., use of mobile devices+data,
to gather experts and idea-generators and implementers around
more focused topics

### example workshop:

*information systems to address Ebola crisis*

Real time monitoring status of staffing, available beds, supplies using mobile phone platforms to enhance health infrastructure and information systems.  One could think about leveraging recent gains in m-health.  

## iteration with experts (likely Friday, Oct 3)

Crucial is saving time by shooting down unworkable ideas
to iterate, refine, and improve towards constraint satisfaction
and meeting design critera. To that end a body of experts
must be made available to evaluate short pitches (ideally 2-5 minutes;
shorter if idea is clearly in need of existential improvement)
from many groups. 

E.g., these could be at the top of every hour, to alternate
between short pitches and deeper discusion.

This also facilitates rapid review

## rapid review

The review process, a way fof quantifying plausibility,
could be as simple as how many experts endorse this idea?

## final review

At the end of design weekend, ideas with most expert approval
are presented to community and judged (including
"community favorite") for suitability of success. Hard and
soft resources (i.e., time and money) may be allocated by the Dean
for most successful ideas.

# logistics for implementation weekend

The logistics for implementation weekend are to be determined
by ideas created in the design weekend.

# necessary planning

- In advance, we must find questions which should be
answered in the Forum

# kickstarting ideas

- As soon as possible, drafts of the forum presentation
should be distributed electronically, e.g., by github,
google drive, or slideshare. They should not be emailed,
and we should not wait until the draft is finalized.

- Idea generators should be encouraged to start
now, gather electronically, and have ideas vetted electronically,
either via googleform or survey platforms such as 
http://www.allourideas.org/

## information to the students

- Slides and media to be shared electonically, broadly, and asap

## information from the students/collaboration

- Ideas to be generated and gathered e.g., google form or survey tools,
as above

- durign event, hackathon platforms such as challengepost.com or hackerleague.com
might be useful.
